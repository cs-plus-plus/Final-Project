# AP Computer Science A Final Project (Swing)

This project requires you to design and implement a Java-based game or simulation using **Eclipse** with **Java Swing**. The project is divided into four phases, detailed below:

---

## Phase I - Proposal
Submit all three pages together (one per team):

### Page 1
- **Title**: Name your project/game.
- **Team Members**: List names and period number. Work with your **tablemates**.
- **Project Summary**: Describe your project in detail, including:
  - Game/simulation operation
  - Rules
  - Number of players
  - Artificial intelligence elements
  - Special features
- **Summary Length**: Typically ½ to ¾ page.

### Page 2
- **UML Diagram**: Create a UML diagram in **Lucidchart** that includes:
  - All classes, ~~with at least one abstract class and one interface~~
  - Private data members
  - Public and private (helper) methods
  - Class Composition (“has-a” relationships)
  - Inheritance (“is-a” relationships)
  - ~~Interface (“does-a” relationships)~~
- Use Lucidchart to create an electronic form of this diagram in landscape orientation. Update this diagram as your project develops.

### Page 3
- **Screenshots and Mock-ups**: Use **Canva** to create wireframes/mock-ups of each screen in your project. Include multiple screens if your project presents the user with different views, and add brief descriptions of each.

**Note**: A thorough proposal will help prevent roadblocks, programming issues, and bugs.

## Phase II – Java Program
Your program must use **Java Swing** for the graphical interface and meet the following criteria:

1. **Operators**: Use at least two relational (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`) and two logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`).
2. **If Statements**: Include at least two.
3. **Loop**: Include at least one.
4. **Student-Designed Classes**: Create at least three, each with three methods.
5. **Class Composition**: Use at least one “has-a” relationship (e.g., a `MusicLibrary` class with an array of `Songs`).
6. **Class Interaction**: Each class should call method(s) from another class.
7. **Inheritance**: Implement a superclass ~~(at least one abstract class)~~ and use an inheritance hierarchy (“is-a” relationship).
8. **List and Traversal**: Use a list in at least one class, traversed and accessed with a `for` loop.
9. **Algorithmic Complexity**: Include a method demonstrating high problem-solving ability (refer to the grading rubric).
10. **Comments**: Include comments explaining key logic points.
11. **Naming**: Use meaningful names for classes, methods, variables, and instance variables.
12. **Javadocs**: Include `@param`, `@return`, etc., for each method in student-designed classes.

### Milestones
- **Milestone 1** : Show basic functionality (no animation, sounds, or levels required).
- **Milestone 2** : Majority of classes implemented, ~~including an abstract class and an interface with interaction.~~
- **Milestone 3** : Program completion at 95% (final details may include graphics, sounds, or special features).

**Note**: Late projects incur a 10% deduction per day.

## Phase III – Project Submission
Submit the project by pushing it to **GitHub and GitHub Classroom**. Ensure your submission includes:

- **Project Folder**: The complete project.
- **Final UML Diagram**: In **PDF** format.
- **GitHub Classroom Submission**: Provide:
  - A ~~YouTube~~ video link (public or unlisted, NOT private)
  - Game description
  - "How to Play" instructions
  - Special features

---

## Phase IV – Presentation (Must not exceed 5 minutes)
Submit a ~~YouTube~~ video presentation. The video should include:

1. **Title**
2. **Description of Program Operation**: Demonstrate the program.
3. **UML Diagrams**: Include for each class.
4. **Inheritance Hierarchy**: Describe your use of inheritance.
5. **Citation of External Code**: Mention any second-party code used.
6. **Conclusion**:
   - **Evaluation**: Reflect on the final product.
   - **Learning Outcome**: Describe specific learnings from this project.

## Tips for Success
1. **Start Early**: Allow sufficient time for planning, coding, and debugging.
2. **Test Your Program**: Conduct thorough tests at each stage.
3. **Debugging**: Use `System.out.println()` statements to track values and troubleshoot issues.
